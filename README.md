Project: Submit Three Potential Capstone Project Ideas and Discuss with Your Mentor

I know that the prompt says to submit three ideas however, there's one particular idea that has interested me from the very start of this course and after some discussion with my Mentor, it is the one I've decided to pursue. 

For a little over a year, I've been utilizing a wearable known as WHOOP. Names like Fitbit, Apple Watch and Garmin Vivosport are usually the first names that come to mind when it comes to the wearables. While I believe that these technologies can promote the formation of healthier habits, WHOOP takes it to the next level.

This device is minimilist in nature (there is no screen interface directly on the device), the data and insights it provides pack quite a punch. Essentially what WHOOP does is it continuously tracks a set health markers (like heart rate and heart-rate variability, which I will get into later) and provides this information via two primary metrics: Strain and Recovery. With this information, you are better able to understand the effects of your training while also adjusting it for days that your body may not be fully recovered to take on a substantial cardiovascular load (i.e. active recovery and rest days). 

What WHOOP Strain does is measures and individual's total cardiovascular load over a specific time domain and relays that information to the user on a scale from zero to 21, with 0 being absolutely no activity and 21.0 being the maximal load one could attain in a day. It does not measure steps or the miles you ran -- instead by tracking heart rate during workouts it is able to gauge your physiological response to the stimulus and determine the impact that activity had on your body. Also, because you wear it continuously, it is able to track your response to non-training events like grocery shopping, cooking dinner, etc. 

WHOOP Recovery works the other side of the training equation i.e. it measures the body's ability to adapt to a training stimulus. This is primarily through tracking sleep in addition to heart-related measures like resting heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). The strap is able to track time spent in bed, time spent asleep, in the various stages of sleep (light, REM, and Deep), and the total number of sleep cycles. Also, HRV is used due to it's correlation with both subsequent athletic performance and previous day's training load and by being able to track it, you have the potential to get better insights into your fitness/fatigue balance. 

While WHOOP has provided me with amazing and actionable information, I want to go deeper. So I've created a spreadsheet with daily observations (from the past 4 months) on the following variables:

- Strain score (on a scale from 0-21)
- Recovery score (as a %)
- Sleep Perfomance score (sleep your body needs vs. the sleep achieved each night, as a %) 
- Max Heart Rate (highest heart rate for that specific day)
- Average Heart Rate (average heart rate from all activities for that day)
- Calories (approximate calories burned that day)
- Heart-Rate Variability (as measured during slow wave sleep and uses the metric RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)
- Resting Heart Rate (measured at complete rest during your deepest sleep each night)
- Time In Bed (in hrs)
- Time Spent in Light Sleep stage (in hrs)
- Time Spent in REM Sleep (in hrs)
- Time Spent in Deep Sleep (in hrs)
- Total Sleep (in hrs)
- Total Sleep Cycles 

The 'big' question I hope to answer is the following: can I predict my future fitness/fatigue balance based on the variables listed above?

With so many variables, I feel like there are certain areas of my lifestyle that I may be overlooking and the question I listed above is a starting point. There may be other trends/ patterns in the data that take me down another 'rabbit hole', so to speak. Only time will tell what I discover!
